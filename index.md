# Mathematics, Data Science, and Programming
These fields will empower our future.
You can empower your life learning these disciplines!

You are invited to a seven week work program at Archipel University introducing our vision for a new curriculum in these fields.
To an exciting tour through mathematical, scientific and philosophical ideas,
the cornerstones of this big picture of
&bdquo;mathematics, data science and programming&ldquo;.
Aware of the human condition of uncertainty and confusion,
we lay out a student journey
that promises understanding and possible certainty,
for those who put up with the necessary frustration and pain
of making every proof your own,
until you finally get the ideas.

Beyond numbers we connect fundamental ideas:
introducing simple notation shows
why formal definitions clarify what is talked about,
and rigorous proof reveal certainty.

Learn about the ominous Omega &Omega; of creation
Clearly observing and measuring,
About models of reality and the truth.

It is a metareal introduction to the magic of mathematics.
Enroll on a journey where you can expand your mind 
and learn to realize your ideas in a program.

## About Me
Hello, I am Gregor Kappler,

I'm a independent consultant, data-scientist, programmer, and researcher.
I authored [CombinedParsers.jl](https://github.com/gkappler/CombinedParsers.jl), an open source julia parser package, have been lecturing Multivariate Statistical Methods ([videos, German](https://www.metheval.uni-jena.de/lehre%5Fcourses.php?course=195)) and worked as a senior data scientist and software developer.

I am looking forward to help your business organization develop and deploy software,
predictive models and visualizations to process and understand business information.

About me, professionally:


### Programming {#programming}

I have been developing thoughout his live in many languages.
Today I fancy functional languages like [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [elm](https://elm-lang.org/) ("javascript haskell"), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and lisp (emacs afficionado) to get his work done and automated.
Before, I had professionally worked with javascript, java, and C for over a decade; after being initiated with Turbo Pascal and Basic as a youngster.
In close to 3 decades, I have gained experience on all layers of a full-stack deployment, some on expert level, some sufficient to always find a way.


### Curriculum {#curriculum}

Trained as a mathematician and psychology researcher I have worked as a lecturer and researcher at the University of Vienna and the University of Jena.
For my PhD in 2007 I implemented an expert system and a neural network for semantic text analytics.
As Senior Consultant for Autonomy, I have been working for software vendors developing mainly java web frontends and services for semantic search.
I have been leading a series of predictive analytics projects as Principal Data Scientist EMEA for Fuzzy Logix, deploying in-database analytic solutions and heading a development team.


### Psychometric Modeling {#psychometric-modeling}

I researched and implemented logical as well as statistical models for text analysis (in java, R, and julia).
Since 2017 I focus on researching a novel nonparametric psychometric model for text/graph data.
The novel psychometric model is inspiring `FilingForest`, a julia-focused platform for fast unbiased nonparametric measurement comprised of several julia packages:
